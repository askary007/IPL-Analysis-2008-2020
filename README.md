INTRODUCTION:-
IPL is a professional Twenty20 Cricket league founded by the BCCI in 2008.The league has 8 teams representing 8 different Indian cities or states
Here I will work on IPL Data Analysis and Visualization Project using Python where we will explore interesting insights from the data of IPL matches like most run by a player, most wicket taken by a player, and much more from IPL season 2008-2020.

ABOUT DATASET:-
This Dataset contains the match descriptions, results, winners, player of the matches, ball by ball dataset and much more.

There are 193468 rows and 18 columns present in first data set and the second data set have 816 rows and 18 columns.

STEPS IN DATA ANALYSIS:-
Importing Libraries,
Importing IPL Dataset,
Checking IPL Dataset Attributes,
Data Cleaning,
Data Analysing & Visualising.

Conclusion:-
The above IPL Analysis 2008 to 2020 we can see here that the best team throughout the season is Mumbai Indians, best batsman is Virat kholi,best bowler is SL Malinga and the MOM of the series is AB de Villiers,
In this season toss winner get little high chance to win the matches ,
